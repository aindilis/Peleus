Peleus is an implementation of an AgentSpeak agent interpreter 
based on the Jason implementation, with the addition of a STRIPS 
planning module. The connection between AgentSpeak and the planning 
component is based on an abstract framework that, in theory, can 
be adapted to any STRIPS compatible planner. We use two implementations
of Graphplan in this version of the prototype. A C++ implementation 
originally created for the X^2-BDI agent, connected via JNI to the
Java-based Jason, and a slightly modified version of a limited Java 
implementation of Graphplan from Sourceforge. The java binaries for 
these libraries are included in the lib folder, as well as Win32 
binary of the EmPlan library. The link to new planner algorithms
is made by extending the classes of org.soton.peleus.act.planner and
implementing the PlannerConverter interface, which is the actual 
point of contact between Jason and an external planner.
